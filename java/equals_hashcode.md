Whenever a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() must be same as b.hashCode().

#### In practice:
If you override one, then you should override the other. Use the same set of fields that you use to compute equals() to compute hashCode().

> FatMinMin's note: You can return the same hashcode for different objects that return false for equals methods. Just like the hash function may collide.
