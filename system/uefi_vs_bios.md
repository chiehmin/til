# UEFI vs BIOS

[HTG Explains: Learn How UEFI Will Replace Your PC’s BIOS](http://www.howtogeek.com/56958/)

* BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
* UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)

### Features and Comparisions

* BIOS is limited to 16-bit processes and 1MB of memory addressing. UEFI can function in 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
* BIOS uses MBR. UEFI uses GPT (UEFI can also use MBR for compatibility).

NOTE: It’s not possible to put UEFI on BIOS-based motherboards.
